# Salesforce Assignment

## Objective
- To successfully import a dataset into Salesforce

## My Approach
1. For the purpose of this assignment I created a dataset through Mockaroo with five columns and 2000 observations. This dataset consisted of First Name, Last Name, City, Donation Amount, and Emails

2. Imported data into Salesforce NPSP. I utilized the NSPS Data Importer tool to do this.

3. Add new records, set correct character code, and map the fields correctly (important!!!).
